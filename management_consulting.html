                                <h1>Larry’s Lemonade: Help from Carly</h1>
                            </div>

                        <div class="post_content">

                            Larry thinks he may be in trouble. He now faces a lot of competition in the street-side drink business, and his profits are slowly declining. He knows that flavored lemonades like strawberry and pomegranate lemonade are huge hits, but he isn’t sure if
                            spending the extra money for the fruit will bring in enough business. He gives Carly a call. Carly is a management consultant for McBainCG, one of the largest consulting firms in the United States. She assembles a team of associates,
                            analysts, and consultants to help Larry in his trouble. Larry asks Carly to help him discover why his profits are declining and whether or not he should introduce flavored lemonades. He asks them to have it done within the
                            week. After a week, Carly returns with a presentation of her team's recent work. She split up her team in order to solve both the declining profits problem and the flavored lemonade question. The team involved with declining
                            profits looked at Larry’s P&L (profit and loss) statement for the past six months. They looked at two things: his revenue, and his costs. They found that his operating costs had nearly doubled in the past 6 months! Surely this
                            had to be why profits were down. After further investigation, they found that on the particularly hot days, his employees were running an old air conditioner in their stand to keep cool. Since it was so old, it used a lot of
                            power, and Larry’s electricity bill was sky high. They recommended that he invest in a new solar-powered air conditioner that would essentially pay for itself in 3 months. The other team in charge of flavored lemonades developed
                            several metrics for Larry. They first looked at the current price of strawberry and pomegranate flavorings. They then conducted market research on what percentage of the population preferred flavored lemonade over regular lemonade,
                            as well as the preferred price that customers were willing to pay for a glass of strawberry and pomegranate lemonade. Subsequently, they figured out how much of the flavored lemonade market share was up for grabs. Their final
                            conclusion was that if Larry charged an extra 25 cents for the flavored lemonade, his costs would increase by 10% but his revenue would increase by 25%! Larry decides to implement Carly’s ideas, and he soon reaps the benefits.

                            <h2>Management Consulting in a Nutshell</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Management consultants (or just “consultants”), known for their analytical thinking, are hired out by companies to solve problems, usually at a high strategic level. </li>
                                <li>Consultants are extremely good at taking large ambiguous problems ("My profits are in
                            the tank"), finding a way to “structure” the problem, and then finding simple and achievable solutions ("Buy an air conditioner that isn’t from 1970")</li>
                                <li>Depending on the firm, consultants are usually traveling 4 days a week and working 60-70 hour work-weeks.</li>
                                <li>They get the opportunity to talk and work with chief executives and high-level managers at companies across the globe.</li>
                                <li>Many consultants go on to build and create businesses using what they learned in consulting.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Why Engineers in Consulting?</h2>
                            Engineers are problems solvers. Consultants solve problems. Need I say more? Engineering is by nature an extremely difficult field of study with extremely difficult classes. You will hear a lot in consulting about “analytical thinking”, which means using
                            a step-by-step approach to break down complex problems into manageable components. Through the classes engineers take (coding, differential equations, dynamics, etc.), we are conditioned for this exact type of problem solving.

                            <h2>Prominent Management Consultants</h2>

                            Chelsea Clinton, Mitt Romney, John Legend <br>
                            <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-of-the-most-noteworthy-alumni-of-the-top-consulting-firms-like-McKinsey-BCG-and-Bain">Noteworthy Managment Consultants</a>

                            <h2>Meet a Management Consultant</h2>

                            “I love consulting because it's a high-impact way to apply engineering skills. When I interned at a motor company as a product development intern, the impact I made consisted of shaving two grams and two cents from the design of a motor. When I interned
                            at a consulting firm as an associate consultant intern, the impact I made consisted of influencing a major travel agency to adopt our team's recommended sales strategy to improve profits. While both are important things, I
                            felt that the impact I had as a consultant intern was more significant. This opportunity to influence people and organizations is what drew me to consulting. You don't hear about it much at BYU, but there are actually a lot
                            of engineers in the management consulting industry. At the firm I worked at, there were people with backgrounds in mechanical, chemical, civil, and electrical engineering, as well as fluid science and chemistry. Because many
                            of the companies that become the clients of consulting firms will have engineers in their ranks, having an engineering background as a consultant allows you to interface with them in a way an economics major can't. Even if
                            you aren't directly applying things you learn in class to your daily work as a consultant, the rigorous training in problem solving that an engineering major provides is perhaps better preparation for tackling the challenging
                            issues faced by consultants than a business strategy major.” -Takami Kowalski, Associate Consultant at Bain, BYU Mechanical Engineering
